Well... I'm doing it once again -- starting a new notebook. This time, using [[Obsidian]].

**Why?** Primarily two reasons:
1. I neither want to nor can remember every idea, thought, feeling, or esoteric Linux command that ever entered my brain at some point in life. Call it *getting old* or *lazy* or *whatever*... I don't care. The point is, I'm done *even pretending* that my memory at 53 years old is anywhere near what it used to be at its peak (which I suspect was sometime around the time I left [[Microsoft]] and started my own consulting business -- [[Technology Toolbox]]).
2. Since I am now retired, it doesn't make sense to use my [[previous notebooks on GitHub]]:
	- https://github.com/jeremy-jameson/Notebook
	- https://github.com/technology-toolbox/Notebook

I migrated that content out of Microsoft [[OneNote]] many years ago and those repositories served me well for many years.

Earlier today, I started thinking that I need to capture the various configuration details for the [[new media server]] that I've been *"building"* for more weeks than I care to admit. As is often the case, I get an idea, sit down at the computer to search the Internet, start opening countless browser tabs, and -- before I realize it -- wander down the rabbit hole for hours trying to find the *optimal* way to make that idea a reality.

I started this morning off by spinning up a Docker container with [[TiddlyWiki]] -- after seeing it mentioned on [perfectmediaserver.com](https://perfectmediaserver.com) .

**Side note:** [[perfectmediacenter.com]] is written and maintained by [Alex Kretzschmar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-kretzschmar/) (aka [@IronicBadger](https://twitter.com/ironicbadger)) and I originally stumbled upon it while learning how to configure [[mergerfs]] on my new media server.

I tried **TiddlyWiki** for a little bit, but it was quickly apparent that when Alex said, "markdown is supported - yay!" he didn't mean capital "M" [[Markdown]].

That quickly led to numerous browser tabs related to [[Obsidian]]... which, in turn, led to several browser tabs for Nick Milo's excellent YouTube videos on [Obsidian for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3NaIVgSlAVLHty1-NuvPa9V0b0UwbzBd). Fast forward a few hours, and the name I chose for my Obsidian Vault (i.e., my ubiquitous "personal notebook") became somewhat of a no-brainer.

I spent a couple of hours getting tools (e.g., [[git]]) installed and configured just the way I like them -- but hopefully that investment will pay off over the long haul. In other words, I hope that I will eventually look back on hundreds -- or perhaps thousands -- of notes with a feeling of satisfaction akin to [[raising a child]].

Time for some lunch!
