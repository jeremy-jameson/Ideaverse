After using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for the first time today (roughly 2 hours so far), I've got to say... I'm digging it! 😎

For years, I used Visual Studio Code to author Markdown files in my [[previous notebooks on GitHub]]:

	- https://github.com/technology-toolbox/Notebook

The vanilla Obsidian environment feels simple, yet powerful. I'm sure I will eventually add some [[plugins]] to streamline the process of capturing notes, but really the only part that has felt even remotely clunky so far is [[inserting images]] -- and that's only because one of my [[goals]] is minimizing the size of the **[[git]]** repo. Specifically, I've been uploading images to [[Imgur]] and then adding corresponding links in the Markdown.

I just tested how Obsidian handles my old Technology Toolbox notebook (originally authored in [[OneNote]] but migrated to vanilla Markdown after I got tired of [[*wrestling* with OneNote]] for years).

Honestly, I think the experience is quite good:

Perhaps most interesting is how the graph view illustrates that my previous notebook was comprised of numerous "islands" (with very few links between notes):

The corresponding graph view for my new personal notebook is already generating ideas about things to capture in my "**[[Ideaverse]]**."

Now... if I could just do something about that [[README]] file sitting out there all by itself... 😜

💡 **Tip:** After installing Obsidian, always enable the following option - **Files and Links > Automatically update internal links**. (Why is "disabled" the default setting?! 😠)
