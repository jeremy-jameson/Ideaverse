## .gitignore changes

When I woke up this morning, I almost immediately started thinking about my `.gitignore` for Obsidian and decided to fix it.

Due to the fact that Obsidian stores a lot of configuration information in the **.obsidian/** folder -- such as hotkeys and plugins -- it seems like the best choice is to *include* everything in that folder by default (with a few specific exclusions) rather than *excluding* everything and trying to keep track of what *should* be specifically included.

As I discovered with custom hotkeys, the latter approach is likely to lead to configuration changes being lost over time. The former approach -- while somewhat risky if sensitive data within plugins were accidentally leaked through a public repository -- seems, overall, to be the far "safer" option.
### Reference

Christopher Patton provides a detailed explanation of various `.gitignore` options in the following pull request:

https://github.com/github/gitignore/pull/4370

## Configure Git plugin settings

- Customize default commit message and date format
- Automatically pull changes when starting Obsidian
- Pull changes every 5 minutes

While the last two options may not appear to make much sense on a repository used by one person, pulling changes automatically helps when working on the same vault across various environments (e.g. using the Obsidian notebook on my main Windows desktop as well as inside a Linux VM).
## Open daily note on startup

Having Obsidian automatically open my daily note will help me achieve my commitment to using daily notes. ðŸ˜Ž
