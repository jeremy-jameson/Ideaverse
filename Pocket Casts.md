My wife, [[Mandy]], and I have tried various podcast players over the years until finally settling on [Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com/). She uses it on her [[iPhone]], and I use it on my [[Android]] ([[Samsung Galaxy A14]]).

While I don't subscribe to a huge number of podcasts, I find the features in this app fit my needs almost perfectly (e.g., automatically downloading episodes and adding them to my **Up Next** list).
