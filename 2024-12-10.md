I spent most of today going down various *rabbit holes* on the Internet related to [[Obsidian]]. The more I uncover, the more amazed I am with it. In addition to the Obsidian developers, there is a huge community of people sharing their ideas, recommendations, themes, templates, plugins, etc. for Obsidian.

I started off trying to figure out what [[plugins]] to install (in addition to the **Git** plugin that I installed on [[Ideaverse|"Obsidian, Day 1"]]), but that quickly swirled into figuring out if I even have the right *includes* and *excludes* specified in  `.gitignore`. (It turns out I most certainly did not -- since I lost my [[Customizing hotkeys in Obsidian|custom hotkeys]] that I configured last week ðŸ˜¢).

One of the other rabbit holes is the concept of [[daily notes]]. This led to exploring a seemingly never-ending series of blog posts and YouTube videos explaining different ways of tackling this concept.

While somewhat complex, I am intrigued by [[Josh Knipe]]'s system:

[Obsidian Guide: Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Yearly notes](https://vaultofjosh.com/blog/obsidian-periodic-notes/)

In particular, I really like the idea of establishing *monthly goals*, which feed into *weekly goals*, which then feed into *daily tasks, highlights, learnings, and accomplishments*.

My goal for tomorrow is to implement Josh's guide as a starting point before customizing it to suit my preferences.
