In the past, I have created rather lengthy notes to document the steps to install and configure various environments -- whether those be physical machines, such as my primary Windows desktop, or virtual machines used for a variety of purposes. For example, my previous notebook for [[Technology Toolbox]] contains the following:

[STORM - Windows 10 Enterprise x64.md](https://github.com/technology-toolbox/Notebook/blob/main/Infrastructure/STORM%20-%20Windows%2010%20Enterprise%20x64.md)

That note documents the process I initially used back in 2015 to build my previous Windows 10 development environment. (Note that I changed the name of my development desktop from **WOLVERINE** to **STORM** when I rebuilt it in 2018 -- hence the updated date on the note.)

Due to [[Winrot]], I subsequently used the steps captured in that note to periodically rebuild the PC roughly every 18 months or so. While somewhat tedious, the process is actually fairly quick since I primarily just need to copy/paste a bunch of commands into PowerShell.

Since I have switched from writing notes in [[Visual Studio Code]] to [[Obsidian]], I want to try something different this time around. Specifically, my goal is to author many small notes that are linked in such a way that I can still quickly rebuild the PC by following a guide (primarily relying on copy/paste).

This is somewhat of proof-of-concept -- since I am still learning Obsidian -- while also serving as *practice* for improving my proficiency with Obsidian.

I am going to start by copying the entire Markdown file used to build STORM (i.e. my Windows 10 development environment) into my [[Ideaverse]] (a.k.a. my personal notebook):

[[STORM - Windows 10 Enterprise x64]]

From there, I'll "refactor" the contents of that note into "bite size" notes that are linked together.
