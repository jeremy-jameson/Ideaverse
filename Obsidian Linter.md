## Use "lazy" number style for ordered lists

For **Ordered List Style**, set **Number Style** to **lazy** -- since I prefer to have all list items prefixed by "1. " (simplifies `git diff` when reordering items).

Example:

```markdown
1. Move the images
1. Rename the image files
1. Commit the changes to source control
1. Upload the images
```
