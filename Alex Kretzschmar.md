Fantastic resource for building the "*perfect media server*" and pretty much anything else related to self-hosting.

- **Website:** [Welcome to Perfect Media Server! - Perfect Media Server](https://perfectmediaserver.com/)
- **Blog:** [ktz.blog](https://blog.ktz.me/)
- **YouTube:** [KTZ Systems](https://www.youtube.com/@ktzsystems) (subscribed, of course -- yes, he's *that* good! ❤)
- **Podcast:** [Self-Hosted](https://selfhosted.show/) (subscribed on [[Pocket Casts]])

The first couple of his videos I watched had me hooked from the start:

- [What Hard Drive should I buy for my DIY NAS?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09PTfJWF7T8)
- [Secret Management with Ansible Vault and docker-compose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUh8FDLbj8M)

Top-notch content (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
