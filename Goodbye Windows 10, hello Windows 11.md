Last week, I decided to upgrade my PC from Windows 10 to Windows 11. Due to [[Winrot]], I typically rebuild my Windows desktop every couple of years. However, since I just upgraded most of the [[Desktop PC Hardware|hardware]] last year, it already had a relatively fresh installation of Windows 10 and therefore was running fairly smooth.

Nevertheless, it feels like Microsoft reneged on its idea of "Windows as a service" -- something originally put forth by Jerry Nixon at the 2015 Ignite conference, during which he stated that Windows 10 would be the "last version of Windows." Sure, the release cycles have undeniably grown longer, but it doesn't really feel any more like *software as service* than Windows 8, Windows Vista (*shudder*), Windows XP, etc. In other words, you still have to periodically upgrade to a new "major" version of the operating system.

Until the inevitable release of [[Windows 12]], starting fresh with Windows 11 seems to be the right play at this particular time.

Hence, it is time to document how I [[Documenting Infrastructure Environments|build my primary development environment]].
