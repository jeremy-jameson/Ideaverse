# Ideaverse

My personal notebook used to help me remember ideas, thoughts, feelings, esoteric Linux commands, etc.

One of my [[goals]] in sharing notebooks on [[GitHub]] is that the contents of the repository should function *reasonably* well on the GitHub website itself. In other words, I shouldn't always have to `git clone` or `git pull` a repo and then open the corresponding folder in some tool (e.g., [[Visual Studio Code]]) just so I can search for a particular note in order to read -- or, more likely, copy/paste -- some content.

The contents of this repository are authored using [[Obsidian]]. Consequently, there will be slight differences between the way the pages *render* (and consequently *behave*) on GitHub vs. within the Obsidian app. For example, links between notes use the abbreviated "wiki syntax" (e.g., `[[Obsidian]]`) rather than the complete Markdown syntax that GitHub supports (e.g., `[Obsidian](Obsidian)`). Consequently, you can't navigate most of the links on GitHub like you can in the Obsidian app. That's, as they say, "by design." üòé

However, you *can* still quickly search for notes on GitHub and most of the actual content in the notebook should be easily readable and support seamless copy/paste.

For example, suppose you are configuring [[storage]] on a Windows PC and you want to [[change the drive letter for the DVD-ROM drive]]. You can select the corresponding text from the note on GitHub, copy it, and then paste it into a [[PowerShell]] session:

Some conventions are used to help expedite the process of copying relatively large portions of content and executing the corresponding commands quickly (e.g., `cls` "code blocks" followed by headings prefixed by `#` -- which denotes a comment in PowerShell).

If you take the time to clone the repo and open it in Obsidian, you must click the corresponding button on the code block in order to copy the content:

‚ùó This is necessary to avoid issues with copying portions of the corresponding Markdown.

Another benefit of opening the notebook in Obsidian is switching to the graph view, which is already generating ideas about things to capture in my "**[[Ideaverse]]**."
