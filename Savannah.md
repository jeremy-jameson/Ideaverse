My daughter is currently attending [[Oregon State University]] and majoring in [[Mathematics]]. Huzzah!

She will be transferring to my alma mater, the [[University of Colorado - Boulder]], in January 2025 and switching majors to [[Architectural Engineering]].

When Savannah graduated from [[Chaparral High School]] in June 2024, the Jameson family went to [[France]] to celebrate, roughly splitting our time between [[Paris]] and [[Nice]]. Savannah served as our interpreter (thanks to her 4 years of French classes with [["Madame" Schranz]].)

It was a trip of a lifetime! (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
