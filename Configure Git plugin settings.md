## Configure Git plugin settings

- Customize default commit message and date format
- Automatically pull changes when starting Obsidian
- Pull changes every 5 minutes

While the last two options may not appear to make much sense on a repository used by one person, pulling changes automatically helps when working on the same vault across various environments (e.g. using the Obsidian notebook on my main Windows desktop as well as inside a Linux VM).
