At some point since [[Nick Milo]] created his video [introducing hotkeys in Obsidian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDcoBMVJsvk), the folks over at Obsidian (the company) decided to change the defaults. For example, after installing Obsidian on my Windows PC, `Ctrl+E` was bound by default to **Toggle reading view**. Personally, as a new user of Obsidian, I don't find the reading view to be nearly as useful as toggling between **Source** and **Live Preview** modes.

Consequently, I customized the Obsidian hotkeys as follows:

| Action                          | Hotkey   |
| ------------------------------- | -------- |
| Toggle reading view             | `Ctrl+R` |
| Toggle Live Preview/Source mode | `Ctrl+E` |
